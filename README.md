# CommAndCalender

A project intended to create a program which:

- takes a list of events
- converts them into events
- which can be output into the commandline as a schedule
- or exported into a calendar via api key usage

## TO DO

- [x] Add commandline menu loop
- [ ] Create basic event storage format
- [ ] Add pattern recognition for command-line input, for creating events (use lexing concepts?)

- [ ] Adjust event format to match google calendar's events
- [ ] Add timezone detection and settings
- [ ] Add exporting events via google calendar's API
- [ ] Adjust readME and menu to explain api export functionality

## Extensions/Idea Dump

- GUI for app
- Inviting others
- Recurring events
